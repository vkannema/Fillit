# Fillit

Project made with @evory.

The purpose is to make the smallest possible "square" (which can contain holes) with a given list of tetriminos, but the disposition must be as such that it returns the first possible solution when placing them recursively from the top left.

## How to use it

```
git clone https://github.com/vkannema/Fillit
make
```

Usage 
```
./fillit [file]
```

The file must be a list of 26 tetriminos maximum, formated this way :
Exemple :
```
....
....
....
####

...#
..##
...#
....
```
